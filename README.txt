Welcome to http code API!
================================================================================
http API Documentation

=== Overview
The http API provides a simple and efficient way to test HTTP status codes. By using this API, developers can quickly generate responses with specific status codes for testing purposes.

=== How to Use

1. Access the API:
   To use the http API, simply navigate to the following URL format:
   https://http.hisam.dev/:code

   Replace \`:code\` with the desired HTTP status code you want to test. For example, to get a 404 status code response, you would use:

   https://http.hisam.dev/404

2. Receive the Response:
   The API will return a response with the designated status code you specified in the URL.

=== Usage Limits

- Rate Limit: The http API enforces a rate limit of 60 requests per second to ensure fair usage and stability for all users. Exceeding this limit will result in temporary throttling of your requests.

=== Open Source

The http API is an open-source project. You can view, contribute to, and fork the project on GitHub:
[https://github.com/hisamafahri/http](https://github.com/hisamafahri/http)

- Rate Limiting: As mentioned, the API rate limit is set to 60 requests per second. Please adhere to this limit to avoid any disruptions in service.
- No Abuse: Do not use the API for malicious purposes, such as DDoS attacks or other forms of abuse.
